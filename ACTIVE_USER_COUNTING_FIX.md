# Active User Counting System Fix

## Problem Description

The website's active user count was showing incorrect information because it was displaying `onlineUsers` (based on the `isOnline` field) instead of `activeUsers` (based on actual browser activity). This meant users who closed their browser or tab were still being counted as active.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Updated StatsSidebar Component**
- Changed from displaying `onlineUsers` to `activeUsers`
- Updated labels to be more accurate ("Currently browsing the website")
- Now shows only users who actually have the website open

### 2. **Enhanced Browser Event Handling**
- Added `beforeunload` event handler for immediate detection when users close browser/tab
- Added `pagehide` event handler for better mobile browser support
- Both events immediately mark users as inactive

### 3. **Improved User Status Tracking**
- Created `handleUserLeft()` method for better user departure handling
- Enhanced `updateUserStatus()` method to properly handle inactive users
- Added automatic cleanup of stale user sessions

### 4. **Optimized Heartbeat System**
- Reduced heartbeat interval from 15 seconds to 10 seconds
- Reduced heartbeat timeout from 30 seconds to 20 seconds
- More frequent updates for more accurate tracking

### 5. **Automatic Session Cleanup**
- Added periodic cleanup of stale user sessions (every 2 minutes)
- Users inactive for more than 1 minute are automatically marked as offline
- Prevents accumulation of "ghost" users

## Technical Details

### Event Handlers Added
```javascript
// Browser close/tab close detection
window.addEventListener('beforeunload', handleBeforeUnload);
window.addEventListener('pagehide', handlePageHide);

// Tab visibility tracking
document.addEventListener('visibilitychange', handleVisibilityChange);
window.addEventListener('focus', handleFocus);
window.addEventListener('blur', handleBlur);
```

### User Status Fields
- `isOnline`: Basic online status (legacy)
- `isTabActive`: Whether the tab is currently active
- `lastHeartbeat`: Timestamp of last heartbeat
- `lastTabActivity`: Timestamp of last tab activity
- `lastSeen`: Timestamp of last user activity

### Active User Criteria
A user is considered "active" only if:
1. `isTabActive` is `true`
2. `lastHeartbeat` is within 20 seconds
3. User is actually interacting with the website

## Files Modified

1. **`src/components/StatsSidebar.js`**
   - Changed from `onlineUsers` to `activeUsers`
   - Updated labels and descriptions

2. **`src/App.js`**
   - Added `beforeunload` and `pagehide` event handlers
   - Improved cleanup when component unmounts
   - Reduced heartbeat interval to 10 seconds

3. **`src/lib/firebase.js`**
   - Added `handleUserLeft()` method
   - Added `cleanupStaleSessions()` method
   - Reduced heartbeat timeout to 20 seconds
   - Added periodic session cleanup

4. **`test-user-counting.js`**
   - Updated heartbeat timeout to match new system

5. **`test-active-users.js`** (new)
   - Test file to verify the active user counting system

## How It Works Now

1. **User Opens Website**: User is marked as active with `isTabActive: true`
2. **Heartbeat System**: Sends heartbeat every 10 seconds while tab is active
3. **Tab Switching**: User remains active when switching between tabs
4. **Browser Close**: `beforeunload` event immediately marks user as inactive
5. **Mobile Navigation**: `pagehide` event handles mobile browser scenarios
6. **Automatic Cleanup**: Stale sessions are cleaned up every 2 minutes

## Benefits

✅ **Accurate Counts**: Only shows users actually browsing the website
✅ **Real-time Updates**: Immediate detection when users leave
✅ **Mobile Support**: Better handling of mobile browser behavior
✅ **Performance**: Efficient cleanup prevents memory leaks
✅ **Reliability**: Multiple event handlers ensure no missed departures

## Testing

Run the test file to verify the system:
```bash
node test-active-users.js
```

Or in the browser console:
```javascript
testActiveUserCounting()
```

## Monitoring

The system now provides real-time updates through:
- `onUserStats()`: Comprehensive user statistics
- `onActiveUsersCount()`: Real-time active user count
- `onTotalUsersCount()`: Real-time total user count

## Future Improvements

- Add analytics dashboard for user activity patterns
- Implement user session duration tracking
- Add geographic distribution of active users
- Create alerts for unusual activity patterns
